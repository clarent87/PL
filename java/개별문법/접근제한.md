Access Control and Inheritance
The following rules for inherited methods are enforced âˆ’

Methods declared public in a superclass also must be public in all subclasses.

Methods declared protected in a superclass must either be protected or public in subclasses; they cannot be private.

Methods declared private are not inherited at all, so there is no rule for them.
